          My name is Qahramon. I was born on May 11, 2008, in Bekobod, where I
          grew up. At the age of 16 and a half, I moved to Tashkent to work and
          study. I built this personal project in 2025, when I was 17 years old.
          I built this website using React.js.
          <br />
          I began studying at the PROWEB learning center in January 2025. I
          first completed the Frontend Development course and received a
          diploma. After that, I continued studying in the Backend Development
          direction, and in the second month of studying Backend, I built this
          MyStory website.

          Since childhood, I have been interested in the IT field. I have
          explored and learned many areas of IT, gaining experience along the
          way. Now, I am focusing deeply on programming, which is one of my
          biggest passions because I enjoy working on software, games, and
          similar projects.<projects className=""></projects>
